# Zookeeper with Java

A simple Java project where I built a console-based zoo watcher program. The application allows zookeepers to check on different animal habitats through ASCII art and text descriptions.

The project was implemented in stages:

1. **Stage 1 - Print first lines of code:**  
   Print an introductory message and basic status updates for animals.

2. **Stage 2 - Print an image of the animal:**  
   Display ASCII art of specific animals (like the camel) when the program runs.

3. **Stage 3 - Show where animals live:**  
   Store all animal ASCII art in a list, let the user input a habitat number (0â€“5), and display the corresponding
   animal.

4. **Stage 4 - Set the program for zoo staff (Final):**  
   Run the program in a loop so the staff can check multiple habitats.  
   Add an exit command (`exit`) that ends the program with a goodbye message.

## Takeaway

This project taught me how to structure data using arrays, handle both numeric and string input, and implement
continuous loops with exit conditions. It also gave me practice working with multi-line strings and reinforced the
importance of input validation to make a program more user-friendly. By the end, I felt more comfortable building
interactive console applications in Java.
